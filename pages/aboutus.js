                        iconic rock bands, serenity of classical art forms and
                        amusement of comedy shows.

                        cultural uplifting festival of togetherness in not just
                        the state or region, but the whole nation. We have
                        reimagined the lens through which we understand culture
                        and celebration, deriving the cornerstones for this
                        year's edition that shall drive forward our festival.
